Introversion, Intuition, Feelings and Perceiving. In short, I&rsquo;m a creative person who is open to opinions and care about my team members well being. So I believe that someone who got either ESTP or ENFP as a result of the Myer-Briggs test would go well with me since Extroverted people are really proactive and friendly, additionally Sensing and Thinking helps with making logical decisions and solving logical problems like bugs in the project. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c0"></span></p><p class="c11 c22"><span class="c0">Results from the Big Five Personalities test stated that I&rsquo;m more prone to negative thoughts and I&rsquo;m an introverted person. However, I also discovered that my thoughts tend to be more complex and abstract, I&rsquo;m also more of a team player rather than competing with my teammates. In short, being pessimistic allows me to think of the worst situation that can happen during our work therefore we can come up with plans and solutions to remedy those problems. Still for our team to be functional members who are more confident, stable to balance out my negativeness would be perfect. Team members who have a bit of competitiveness in them are also good to have in a team as it helps them to do their best in a project, plus extroverted members are also great since I&rsquo;m not good at working with introverts because I tend to be very awkward around them. </span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.654rzv83z21"><span class="c5 c8">Tools:</span></h1><p class="c11"><span class="c32 c27 c34">I have created a Github account using the school email and a GitHub repository.

However making a game requires a lot of skills, resources and we as university students are still lacking a lot of those requirements. Luckily there are other kinds of games that we can potentially make that use less resources like the once famous mobile game &ldquo;Flappy bird&rdquo; or other simple games on the top chart of the App Store/Google Play(Rigney, 2014). So my plan is to create a simple mobile game that we can put on Google Play for free. As of right now I couldn&rsquo;t settle on the name of the game just yet but I already have ideas of gameplay and other aspects of the game planned.</span></p><p class="c4 c22"><span class="c32 c27 c34"></span></p><h2 class="c18 c22" id="h.i1thjxllej51"><span class="c5 c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation:</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c32 c27 c34">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, making a game is my dream and in order to achieve that dream I need experiences, skills so making a mobile game is a suitable alternative. In addition, the cost of making a mobile game is not a lot(Rigney, 2014) while generating a lot of revenue. For example, there was a very famous game a few years ago called &ldquo;Subway Surfer&rdquo; which cost around $30k while earning almost $450k only in 2018 alone(Fan Studio, 2018). Additionally, mobile phones are almost a necessity in today&rsquo;s world so in theory there are about 7 billions potential consumers and the majority of them have access to the Internet(Lin, 2021).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c0"></span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.zdkut3vmcxn0"><span class="c5 c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description: </span></h2><p class="c11"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c32 c27 c34">This game is considered a mobile, dungeon crawler, bullet hell, 2d top down and roguelike game. In this game, we focus more on gameplay rather than story however the story aspect is still our second most important. Being a 2d game we don&rsquo;t need to focus so much on technical issues but we will make sure that the game won&rsquo;t overheat the player&rsquo;s phone and consume any data when they are not connected to wifi. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c32 c27 c34">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c11 c36" id="h.osjs3h3l1s2v"><span class="c27">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c24">Gameplay:</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c27">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c0">Gameplay is a very important factor as this is the only way we can keep the players from playing once then forget about it. The gameplay loop starts with the player spawning in a room choosing their first perks. Perks are upgrades to the player&rsquo;s character that have many benefits from increasing their health pool to turning them to an overpowered werewolf/similar humanoid creature with some drawbacks. After choosing the perks, players will have to move, using a joystick like system in the lower part of the phone, to the next room where they will face slimes, goblins and some other kind of weak monsters as their first enemy, the difficulty will increase each room the players pass through. The players will have to fight through various rooms until they reach a boss room where defeating the boss will reveal treasures(perks or items) and a way to the next floor. Along the way to the bossroom there will be ways that lead the player to a treasure room, containing items like armour or weapons which will change the player&rsquo;s playstyle. While moving through floors, the players will encounter a shop randomly and trade in game currency to buy perks and items. A blacksmith will also appear randomly between floors to make the items/perks that the players obtained better. Perks and items will only last for the duration of the chapter the player is in. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c32 c27 c34">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be 2 game modes at the launch of the game however if the game is somewhat successful we will add more contents into the game overtime. The first gamemode is the story mode where the player can experience stories with around 5 chapters and each chapter contains 10 floors with different themes, in addition each floor contains 6 procedurally generated rooms with varied roomsized. Finishing every 3 chapters, players will unlock more perks and items that will be added to the perks and items pool in endless mode. Finishing a story will award the player with a new playable character with different designs and attributes that will interact with the items and upgrade differently. At launch, there will be 3 stories and depending on the state of the game the first 2 months we will plan whether or not we should add more contents. The other game mode is an endless mode where the player will travel through floors themed and face monsters corresponding to the stories they are from endlessly or until their character dies. In endless mode, players have lives that correspond to the amount of characters they have maxing out at 3. There will also be a leaderboard system inside the endless mode where the players compete with each other to see who can go further by synergising different items and perks. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c0"></span></p><h3 class="c11 c36" id="h.798xvskx0igx"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c27">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c24">Story:</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c5 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this game, each story will have about 3 parts to it and the first story will be different to the next. For example, the first story will be about a boy who had fallen through a hole which led him to an underground kingdom and he had to navigate his way up with the help of the players. During the journey, the boy will encounter some friends and events, like betrayal or conflicts, to keep the player from getting bored. There will be simple cutscenes to convey the story at the start of the chapter and at the end of the chapter. Every floor there will be some simple dialog about the character&rsquo;s pasts and feelings which will change further into the story. The next story will be about a girl climbing up to heaven to ask the gods about her missing brothers. However some floors on heaven are corrupted so there will be temptation to lure the girl in so that she will fall into the underground kingdom. The third story will reveal some simple twists and it will be an adventure of 2 characters finding each other with the help of a third character. In the end of the third story the player will unlock the third character.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h3 class="c11 c36" id="h.klj5baimhssi"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c24 c32">Technical issues:</span></h3><p class="c11"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">From my personal experience of playing mobile games, my phone tends to get too hot despite it being a new phone so one of the aspects for us to focus on in terms of improving technical issues is to prevent overheating the phone. In order to fulfil that, we decided to limit the frame rate to 30 frames per second(fps) since running a 2d game at 60fps while gameplay might be smooth the overall results seems to be inefficient because 60fps will result in hurt the player&rsquo;s phone as it push the system to overdrive which led to the phone heating up. The game will be online when the player&rsquo;s phone connects to the internet however if there is no connection the game will switch to offline mode. Offline mode means that the player won&rsquo;t have access to any items in the </span><span>in-game</span><span class="c5 c0">&nbsp;store that require premium currency which can be bought with real money. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c0"></span></p><h2 class="c18 c21" id="h.t1jx8d6zn9gm"><span class="c5 c13">Tools and Technology: </span></h2><p class="c11 c22"><span class="c32 c27 c34">There are a lot of programs that can be used to develop a 2d game like Unity, Construct2 and many more. However Unity seems like the best option because it is free to use until the game is out on the market(Mobile game Development: Where to begin? 2020). I believe we also need to either commission or draw all of the spirits ourselves. If we decided to draw the spirits ourselves then I believe softwares such as PhotoshopCC and Clip Studio Paint are needed, those softwares are the ones I use to draw in my free time so I&rsquo;m familiar with them plus they are really easy to get in VietNam. </span></p><p class="c4 c22"><span class="c5 c0"></span></p><h2 class="c18 c22" id="h.qdq7ir3h15cd"><span class="c5 c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skills Required:</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c32 c27 c34">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are just university students, there are a lot of things we need to learn like how to operate the Unity engine efficiently. There are also problems with obtaining the spirits for the game because I know very little about drawing pixel characters and things. However both Unity skills and drawing skills can be learned through youtube tutorials. In order to draw efficiently I will need a tablet but the current situation is preventing me from getting a decent tablet so we might have to change how we get the spirits. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c32 c27 c34"></span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.7y0foc4hd0b9"><span class="c5 c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outcome:</span></h2><p class="c11"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this game turned out to be successful, it would mean that I have made my very first game and that people like it plus I could continue to make content for the game. Additionally, it would mean that I will be making money while doing what I love and I also learned a lot of skills that will be useful in the future. This game will give me an insight into what the game industry is really about so that I will know what to prepare for the future. </span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.k3ztygyp39n"><span class="c5 c8">IT Technologies:</span></h1><h2 class="c18" id="h.swuzpajehggx"><span class="c5 c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud computing:</span></h2><p class="c11 c22"><span class="c0">Cloud computing to my understanding is having computing system resources(often is data storage) without having them tangible. For example, an Iphone with a storage capability of 64gb however in order to increase the amount of storage one usually has to buy a new phone with higher capability. However cloud computing allows customers to in theory save their money and real life spaces. For example, rather than having to buy another Iphone one can utilize Apple&rsquo;s iCloud to save storage space in the phone instead the datas are stored on the servers in the data center in this case Apple&rsquo;s data center. Cloud computing also </span><span>allows</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;employees to work on </span><span>the same project more efficiently since every input of every employee involved will automatically be stored in the data center as well. For example, Google docs is one the cloud computing applications and it helps teams to work together on the same file without much demand. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c0"></span></p><p class="c11 c22"><span class="c0">Cloud computing is getting better and better since there is news in the gaming scene that we can now play games using cloud technology(Henderson, 2021) which means that one no longer needs to own a high-end computer setup to play games smoothly. In the future, it would be very likely that one only needs to own a phone to enjoy PC games given how far cloud computing has evolved. </span><span class="c5 c0">I believe that if cloud gaming becomes successful it won&#39;t be far until we will be making AAA games or a hollywood grade movie using only our phone perhaps in the next three years. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c5"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invention of cloud computing has heavily impacted most employees and especially people who primarily work on computers. Cloud computing has helped employees from losing their work because they forgot to save or unfortunate events occur like a blackout. Instead, employees can focus more on the quality of their work since it will be saved automatically even if someone accidentally closes the program that the work is on. Cloud computing has also helped me a lot. Projects and reports have been easier ever since I discovered cloud computing because I don&rsquo;t really have to worry about saving so I saved a bit of time to think about the content of the work I&rsquo;m doing. My friends have also started to use cloud computing applications like google docs and some even use cloud computing programs exclusively which I don&rsquo;t really mind since it makes teamwork somewhat more fun because we can all work on the same file and don&rsquo;t have to pass around save files. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c32 c27 c34">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c18" id="h.a1uvf0ay47qo"><span class="c5 c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artificial intelligence and machine learning:</span></h2><p class="c11"><span class="c32 c27 c34">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of Artificial intelligence(AI) and machine learning is really hard determine because we are at the point where some AI are so smart that when one chat to them it feels just like talking to another human being like an application on the App Store called &ldquo;Replika&rdquo;, on the other hand there are AI like most Roombas on the market which are not very advance and often got stuck. However there are also AIs that are very smart like the robot dog from Boston Dynamics so it is very hard to determine that state of AI and machine learning. If I have to guess, it seems like AI and machine learning technology are really close to those depicted in movies. We are only a few years short until the AI we developed is somewhat similar to those in movies. In the next three years I don&rsquo;t think there will be much of a difference from now unless there are some kind of big breakthrough otherwise I think the AI may get better but only a little bit. The current state of AI is not attractive enough for mainstream media to talk about which results in people knowing little about robots and AI so there aren&rsquo;t enough resources being used for research developing AI. In addition, there is this idea that AI will take over jobs and humankind which some people take it seriously which led to the concept making AI/Robots sounds discouraging. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c32 c27 c34"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covid have definitely impacted the development of AI and machine learning since people spend their time inside and online so developers have the opportunity to publish their AI and test out how it works. When Covid ends, my prediction is that there would be more people either experienced talking to an AI, since some AI are used to treat depression and various mental issues, or their friends talking about AI. As of right now, AI and machine learning are probably not going to replace anything. In fact AIs might help us do annoying activities like organising our photos or files. However, 20 or 30 years from now the situation might change since AIs and robots will definitely replace humans with dangerous jobs like soldiers because no one likes wars. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c32 c27 c34"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If AI ended up becoming my teacher it would be very interesting to see how people react since most movies and games about AIs have already predicted what would happen if it took over most of the human jobs. I have chatted with a handful of AIs and I can&rsquo;t say that they haven&rsquo;t kept me busy but I don&rsquo;t think that AI and machine learning have affected me much aside from entertainment like games. I also don&rsquo;t think that my family would be affected very much with the exception of a smarter roomba if it really will exist. </span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.b8qmwgi6k3he"><span class="c5 c8">IT Work:</span></h1><p class="c11"><span class="c5 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know about IT work, I have decided to watch some videos about IT professionals. According to a channel named &ldquo;codingisforyou&rdquo; the work of an IT professional varied a lot but most of the time I will find myself turning real world problems into software solution. He also added that most of the works are problem solving related works. Another channel under the name &ldquo;DC CyberSec&rdquo; displayed through his video &ldquo; A Day In The Life Of A Cyber Security Specialist (Government Contractor)&rdquo; what kind of work an IT professional does. His day consists of attending a meet, checking help tickets and email, inspecting logs, redundancy testing with system admin at an offsite data center, checking high risk log entries, remedy vulnerability, Inspecting traffics and write a report. So far what Mr DC Cybersec did in his seems to confirm what Mr codingisforyou said but there are many field within the IT profession to works should be different from each of the fields. Another peak into a day of an IT professional by a channel called &ldquo;I.T.Career Questions&rdquo;. His day to day work life consists of checking tickets, answering the phone however just like Mr codingisforyou said the works of an IT professional is different every day Mr I.T.Career Questions also share the same opinion. Mr I.T.Career Questions works seem to involve fixing related to database, user&rsquo;s accounts. The company MarathonOilCorp also put out a video tackling what the day to day of their IT professional looks like. Their IT professional is an End User Computing Configuration Supervisor so his job is to make sure that emails are going through, mobile devices as well as PCs are working like intended. He also spends his time working with the project team to see whether they need any tech support now or in the future. He also shares the same idea that there are no typical things that IT professionals do. A day of an IT System Admin (security) by PushToProd seems to be about the same as the other IT professionals above. However, his day seems rather active compared to the ones earlier but he still ended up doing the same kind of work, from going around the office checking on his coworkers to attending meetings and making the code. Mr PushToProd actually showed us what he did in terms of programming. The last video from an IT Support Specialist &ldquo;The Bearded I.T. Dad&rdquo; talking about his life. The work that he does during his day consists of answering support tickets and emails, managing the network, making sure that mobile devices are uptodate, printer maintenance and various more but he skipped over most of &nbsp;them in the video. In the video he also made a point about job titles in IT saying that despite what the job title said people in IT generally do various different things. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c5 c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Mr. codingisforyou video, he generally interact with employers and contractors since he is a programmer and he mostly do works that are contract based. Mr. codingisforyou did interact with other IT professionals but he interact with them through the programs that they wrote since he mostly was hired to remedy problems. Mr DC CyberSec did not talk much in his video however through the footage. I believe that he only interacts with either his higher ups or fellow IT professionals or both because he&rsquo;s only ever seen talking to someone in a meeting and in the video he did mention meeting with a fellow IT professional to fix something in the server. Mr I.T. Career Questions stated in his video that his work includes answering the phone and going out to facilities to help with tech support so I assume most of the people that he interacts with are his clients and his coworkers which may or may not be an IT professional. The IT professional from MarathonOilCorp stated that he mostly interacts with other employees in the company because he is an End User Computing Configuration Supervisor and his work revolves around those employees. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c32 c27 c34">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking through a lot of these videos I see that they have one similarity which is they spend most of their time sitting in an office and most likely in cubicles or some small places. Mr codingisforyou even give out advices to be more health in the IT field because of the workplace environment. One exception is the place where Mr PushToProb works since that place seems very spacious and he even gets to move around a lot. There is a big courtyard where he took a walk in the video. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c32 c27 c34">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the videos did not focus much on the challenges of IT however Mr codingisforyou did talk a lot about the challenges he faced. The most challenging for him is being hired to fix the codes in someone&rsquo;s programs. Another aspect that is challenging for him is the interaction between him and the managers because they created a lot of stress for him like sending him across the city despite the traffic being bad. </span></p><h1 class="c2" id="h.vu6kl27f9je9"><span class="c35">Reference:</span></h1><p class="c11"><span>codingisforyou.
